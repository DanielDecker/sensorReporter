## `gpio.rpi_gpio.RpiGpioSensor`

A Sensor that can behave as either a Polling Sensor or a Background Sensor that reports the HIGH/LOW status of a GPIO pin.
Additionally the Sensor can detect toggle events and report the time of the event to different locations depending on the event duration.

### Dependencies

The user running sensor_reporter must have permission to access the GPIO pins.
To grant the `sensorReporter` user GPIO permissions add the user to the group `gpio`:

```
sudo adduser sensorReporter gpio
```

Depends on RPi.GPIO.

```
sudo pip3 install RPI.GPIO
```

### Basic parameters

Parameter | Required | Restrictions | Purpose
-|-|-|-
`Class` | X | `gpio.rpi_gpio.RpiGpioSensor` |
`Connections` | X | dictionary of connectors | Defines where to publish the sensor status for each connection. This sensor has 3 outputs, see below. Look at connection readme's for 'Actuator / sensor relevant parameters' for details.
`Pin` | X | IO Pin | Pin to use as sensor input, using the pin numbering defined in `PinNumbering` (see below).
`Level` | | DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR | When provided, sets the logging level for the sensor.
`Poll` | | Positive decimal number | The interval in seconds to check for a change of the pin state. If the new state is present for a shorter time then the specified time noting is reported. Can be used as debounce. When not defined `EventDetection` must be configured.
`EventDetection` | | RISING, FALLING, or BOTH | When defined, Poll is ignored. Indicates which GPIO event to listen for in the background.
`PUD` | | The Pull UP/DOWN for the pin | Defaults to "DOWN"


### Advanced parameters
For a valid configuration the basic parameters marked as required are necessary, all advanced parameters are optional

Parameter | Required | Restrictions | Purpose
-|-|-|-
`Values` | | list of strings or dictionary | Values to replace the default state message of the `Switch` output (default is OPEN, CLOSED). For details see below.
`Short_Press-Threshold` | | decimal number | Defines the lower bound of short button press event in seconds, if the duration of the button press was shorter no update will be send. Usful to ignor false detection of button press due to electrical interferences. (default is 0)
`Long_Press-Threshold` | | decimal number | Defines the lower bound of long button press event in seconds, if the duration of the button press was shorter a short button event will be triggered. Can be determinded via the sensor-reporter log when set on info level. If not defined all button press events will be threated as short press.
`Btn_Pressed_State` | | LOW or HIGH | Sets the expected input level for short and long button press events. Set it to `LOW` if the input pin is connected to ground while the button is pressed (default is determined via PUD config value: `PUD = UP` will assume `Btn_Pressed_State: LOW`)

#### Values parameter
With this parameter the default state messages of the of the `Switch` output can be overwrite.
Two different layouts are possible.
To override the state message for all defined connections, configure a list of two string items:

```yaml
Values:
    - 'ON'
    - 'OFF'
```
The fist string will be send if the input is HIGH, the second on LOW.

If separate state messages for each connection are desired, configure a dictionary of connection names containing the string item list:

```yaml
Values:
    <connection_name>:
        - 'ON'
        - 'OFF'
    <connection_name2>:
        - 'high'
        - 'low'
```
If a configured connection is not present in the Values parameter it will use the sensor default state messages (OPEN, CLOSED). 

### Global parameters
Can only be set for all GPIO devices (RpiGpioSensor and RpiGpioActuator).
Global parametes are set in the `DEFAULT` section.
See example at the bottom of the page.

Parameter | Required | Restrictions | Purpose
-|-|-|-
`PinNumbering` | | BCM or BOARD | Select which numbering to use for the IO Pin's. Use BCM when GPIO numbering is desired. BOARD refers to the pin numbers on the P1 header of the Raspberry Pi board. (default BCM)

### Outputs
The RpiGpioSensor has 3 outputs which can be configured within the 'Connections' section (Look at connection readme's for 'Actuator / sensor relevant parameters' for details).

Output | Purpose
-|-
`Switch` | Where the OPEN/CLOSED messages are published. When using with the openHAB connection configure a contact/string item.
`ShortButtonPress` | Location to publish an update after a short button press happend. Which are two chages of the logic level at the selected pin (eg. LOW, HIGH, LOW) and the duration of the button press is between Short_Press-Threshold and Long_Press-Threshold. For the recommended setup see example config #â€‹2 at the bottom of the page. When using with the openHAB connection configure a datetime/string item.
`LongButtonPress` | Location to publish an update after a long button press happend, requires `Long_Press-Threshold`. When using with the openHAB connection configure a datetime/string item.

## `gpio.rpi_gpio.RpiGpioActuator`

Commands a GPIO pin to go high, low, or if configured with SimulateButton it goes high for half a second and then goes to low.
A recieved command will be sent back on all configured connections to the configured return topic, to keep them up to date.

### Dependencies

The user running sensor_reporter must have permission to access the GPIO pins.
To grant the `sensorReporter` user GPIO permissions add the user to the group `gpio`:

```
sudo adduser sensorReporter gpio
```

Depends on RPi.GPIO.

```
sudo pip3 install RPI.GPIO
```

### Parameters

Parameter | Required | Restrictions | Purpose
-|-|-|-
`Class` | X | `gpio.rpi_gpio.RpiGpioActuator` |
`Connections` | X | dictionary of connectors | Defines where to subscribe for messages and where to publish the status for each connection. Look at connection readme's for 'Actuator / sensor relevant parameters' for details.
`Pin` | X | IO Pin | Pin to use as actuator output, using the pin numbering defined in `PinNumbering` (see below).
`Level` | | DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR | When provided, sets the logging level for the sensor.
`ToggleDebounce` | | decimal number | The interval in seconds during which repeated toggle commands are ignored (default 0.15 seconds)
`InitialState` | | ON or OFF | Optional, when set to ON the pin's state is initialized to HIGH. Ignores InvertOut (default OFF)
`SimulateButton` | | Boolean | When `True` simulates a button press by setting the pin to HIGH for half a second and then back to LOW. In case of `InitalState` ON it will toggle the other way around.
`InvertOut` | | Boolean | Inverts the output when set to `True`. When inverted sending `ON` to the actuator will set the output to LOW, `OFF` will set the output to HIGH.

### Global parameters
Can only be set for all GPIO devices (RpiGpioSensor and RpiGpioActuator). Global parametes are set in the `DEFAULT` section
Parameter | Required | Restrictions | Purpose
-|-|-|-
`PinNumbering` | | BCM or BOARD | Select which numbering to use for the IO Pin's. Use BCM when GPIO numbering is desired. BOARD refers to the pin numbers on the P1 header of the Raspberry Pi board. (default BCM)

### Outputs / Inputs
The RpiGpioActuator has only one output and input.
The input expects ON, OFF, TOGGLE or a datetime string as command. 
While ON, OFF set the GPIO pin accordingly, TOGGLE and and a datetime string will toggle the pin. 
Can be connected directly to a RpiGpioSensor ShortButtonPress / LongButtonPress output. 
The output will send the pin state as ON / OFF afer a change.
When using with the openHAB connection configure a switch/string item.
